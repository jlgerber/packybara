## Notes

### versionpin notation
I need a way to set versionpins from the command line. What about this?
```bash
<distribution>@role:<role>.level:<level>.platform:<platform>.site:<site>
```
where role, level, paltform, and site pairs are optional, and their order is not fixed. 
We can also use single letter abreviations. 

```
maya-2018.sp3@l:bayou => maya-2018.sp3@level:bayou.role:any.platform:any.site:any
```

### Transaction
```
 select transaction_id,table_name,action,row_data,changed_fields from audit.logged_actions where transaction_id = (select distinct transaction_id from audit.logged_actions order by transaction_id desc limit 1 offset 0);
 ```

 ```
 insert platform(path) values ('any.cent8_128'),('any.cent9_128');
 update platform set path='any.cent8_64' where path='any.cent8_128';
 ```
